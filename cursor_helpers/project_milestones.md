- Advanced user features implementation
- Cost optimization strategies

#### Week 10: Testing & Complete Migration
- End-to-end testing of AWS implementation
- Performance comparison and tuning
- Security review and implementation
- Complete cutover from Firebase/Vercel to AWS

#### Deliverables
- Fully functional AWS implementation
- Enhanced scalability and performance
- Advanced security features
- Complete migration with all data preserved

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Accelerated Timeline Risk**
   - **Risk**: Quality compromises due to the compressed 2-week MVP schedule
   - **Mitigation**: Focus strictly on core functionality, limit scope, daily standups to track progress

2. **AI Content Quality**
   - **Risk**: Generated scenarios may lack quality with minimal prompt engineering time
   - **Mitigation**: Start with proven prompt templates, manual review of initial outputs

3. **Technical Debt**
   - **Risk**: Rushing the MVP creates significant technical debt
   - **Mitigation**: Document known shortcuts, allocate dedicated time in Phase 2 for refactoring

4. **Cost Management**
   - **Risk**: AI processing costs could exceed budget with inefficient implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Implement basic caching from day one, monitor API usage closely

5. **Migration Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Challenges transitioning from MVP to AWS infrastructure
   - **Mitigation**: Design with migration in mind, use clean interfaces between components

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Metrics (2-Week)
- MVP released within 14-day timeframe
- Core functionality working (problem transformation with company context)

## Project Overview

AlgoIRL (Algorithms In Real Life) transforms abstract algorithm problems into realistic interview scenarios tailored to specific companies. This platform helps developers prepare for technical interviews by practicing LeetCode problems (starting with the Blind 75 collection) presented in the context of real-world business scenarios relevant to their target companies.

## Hybrid Implementation Approach

This project will follow a hybrid approach optimized for both learning and scaling potential:

1. **Phase 1**: Rapid MVP development using Firebase + Vercel
2. **Phase 2**: AWS migration for enterprise scalability and learning

This approach allows for:
- Faster time-to-market with a working product
- Lower initial complexity and development costs
- Practical learning experience in both modern development and enterprise cloud
- Natural transition path to enterprise-grade infrastructure

## Project Goals

1. Create a repository of the Blind 75 LeetCode problems
2. Develop an AI system that can transform abstract algorithm problems into company-specific scenarios
3. Build a user-friendly AlgoIRL platform where users can select companies and receive contextually relevant problems
4. Implement efficient caching to minimize redundant AI processing
5. Establish a functional MVP with Firebase + Vercel
6. Gain practical experience with both modern serverless and enterprise AWS architectures
7. Provide a valuable tool that enhances technical interview preparation
