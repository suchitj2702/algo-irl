 Project Management:
  - Reference @repository_documentation for current implementation and file structure
  - Reference @project_milestones.md for all feature implementations, the implementation may have been updated in the codebase, take the code as the source of truth
  - Reference @documentation.md for all API endpoints, again, implementation may have been updated in the codebase, take the code as the source of truth
  - Ensure new code aligns with defined milestones
  - Ensure that you cleanup all unused code paths, so that the repository doesn't contain redundant code
  - Once the code change has been made, update repository_documentation.md with the latest details
